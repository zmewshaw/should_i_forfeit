# Should_I_Forfeit
## About
Here is a project I started to settle the argument of whether or not it is worth it to forfeit a game in the popular online game: League of Legends. It is able to accomplish this through running statistical analysis on data queried from the Riot Games API.

## Purpose
I started this project for two main reasons,
- I have always believed that it is almost always better to not forfeit in any game due to the fact that **two** games need to be one to equal the opposite outcome of winning the initial game.
    - For those reading that have not played competitive online games, this is a ***very*** unpopular opinion. Most people that believe the contrary will provide the counter-argument "By forfeitting, you are able to get into the next game faster, putting you closer to a winning opportunity". Although this statement is correct in itself, it ***almost always*** makes the incorrect assumption that the following games have a high enough chance of winning to make up for the lost opportunity in the current one. Given a players winrate is generally between 40% and 60%, this is simply not the case.
- I have always struggled to understand web development as I have never had curriculum surrounding it in school. I figured that starting a web development project utilizing other subjects and topics that I am interested in would be the best way to get over it.

## How to Run
This project requires an API key that expires every 24 hours until I present Riot Games with a product I am satisfied with and it is approved. Therefore, I can only provide an example of how it would run given a users information.
