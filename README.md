# riot-ff
 A personal project I started to make a website that determines whether or not it is worth it to forfeit a game of League of Legends in the interest of saving time.

This project uses the Riot API to query a players winrate from the Riot Games database and combines this data with user input to simulate thousands of games. This is not something that can be tested through statistical analysis as both game time and points gained or lost both change based on the predetermined outcome of the game.
